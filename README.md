# zpl-printer
zpl-printer is JavaScript library for printing to Zebra printers. It's goal is to make printing to Zebra printers as easy as possible with JavaScript while still leveraging the power of ZPL

**Print through the web app with ZPL (Zebra Printer Language)

#### note: this is my first library, so you are welcome to contribute to.
